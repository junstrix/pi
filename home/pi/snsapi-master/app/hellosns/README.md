Hello SNS
====

Introduction
----

These three scripts can be your first examples:

   * `test-read-all.py`: 
   Read all messages from all channels. 
   * `test-read-reply.py`: 
   Read all messages from all channels and choose to reply one. 
   * `test-read-write-all.py`: 
   Read all messages from all channels
   and write a message to all channels. 

Deploy
----

Make link of the following folders to current folder:

   * `snsapi`. 
   * `conf`. 

Fill in configuration information in `conf` folder. 
You have learned that in our inline tutorial in `snscli`. 
To be simple, you can use `snscli` to create channels, 
save to config files and then copy to current conf folder.
